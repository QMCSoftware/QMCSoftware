# Quasi-Monte Carlo Community Software

Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are used to approximate multivariate integrals. They have four main components: an integrand, a discrete distribution, summary output data, and stopping criterion. Information about the integrand is obtained as a sequence of values of the function sampled at the data-sites of the discrete distribution. The stopping criterion tells the algorithm when the user-specified error tolerance has been satisfied. We are developing a framework that allows collaborators in the QMC community to develop plug-and-play modules in an effort to produce more efficient and portable QMC software. Each of the above four components is an abstract class. Abstract classes specify the common properties and methods of all subclasses. The ways in which the four kinds of classes interact with each other are also specified. Subclasses then flesh out different integrands, sampling schemes, and stopping criteria. Besides providing developers a way to link their new ideas with those implemented by the rest of the QMC community, we also aim to provide practitioners with state-of-the-art QMC software for their applications.

## Installation

~~~
pip install qmcpy
~~~

**For Developers/Contributors**

This package is dependent on the `qmcpy/` directory being on your python path. This is easiest with a virtual environment. For example, using `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`

~~~
mkvirtualenv qmcpy
git clone https://github.com/QMCSoftware/QMCSoftware.git
cd QMCSoftware
setvirtualenvproject
add2virtualenv $(pwd)
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
make qrng
~~~

 
To check for successful installation run

~~~
make tests
~~~

<hr>

## Documentation 

The QMCPy Read the Docs is located [here](https://qmcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with HTML, PDF, and EPUB downloads available [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/qmcpy/downloads/).

Automated project documentation is compiled with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/). To compile HTML, PDF, or EPUB docs locally into `sphinx/_build/` first install additional requirements with 

~~~
pip install -r requirements/dev_docs.txt
~~~

and then run one of the following three commands

~~~
make doc_html
make doc_pdf
make doc_epub
~~~

## QMCPy

The central package including the 5 main components as listed below. Each component is implemented as abstract classes with concrete implementations. For example, the lattice and Sobol sequences are implemented as concrete implementations of the `DiscreteDistribution` abstract class. A complete list of concrete implementations and thorough documentation can be found [here](https://qmcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html) on our Read the Docs site. 

- **Stopping Criterion:** determines the number of samples necessary to meet an error tolerence.
- **Integrand:** the function/process whose expected value will be approximated.
- **True Measure:** the distribution which the integrand is defined for.
- **Discrete Distribution:** a generator of nodes/sequences, that can be either iid (for Monte Carlo) or low-discrepancy (for quasi-Monte Carlo), that mimic a standard distribution.
- **Accumulate Data:** stores information from integration process.

## Workouts and Demos

Workouts extensively test and compare the componenets of the the QMCPy package.
Demos, implemented as Jupyter notebooks, demonstrate functionality and uses cases for QMCPy. They often draw from and explore the output of various workouts. 

To run all workouts (~10 min) use the command

~~~
make workout
~~~

<hr>

## Unitests

Combined fast (<1 sec) and long (<10 sec) unittests can be run with

~~~
make tests
~~~

To run either fast or long unittests use either of the following 2 commands

~~~
python -W ignore -m unittest discover -s test/fasttests
python -W ignore -m unittest discover -s test/longtests
~~~
