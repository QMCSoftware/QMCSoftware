"""Check (and fix) that a Google-style docstring section's body is indented
deeper than its own header line.

Google-style sections (``Args:``, ``Returns:``, ``Examples:``, ...) delimit
their body by indentation, not by a closing marker. ``mkdocstrings``' Google
docstring parser (via ``griffe``) relies on that indentation to know where a
section's content starts and ends -- a body written at the SAME indent as its
header (instead of one level deeper) is not recognised as belonging to the
section, which is why e.g. an ``Examples:`` section's ``>>>`` lines can fail
to render as a doctest block in the built HTML even though they look fine as
plain text/in an IDE.

Wrong (body at the same indent as the header):

    Examples:
    >>> f(2)
    4

Right (body indented one level deeper):

    Examples:
        >>> f(2)
        4

A section's body is scanned one "chunk" at a time, where a chunk is a maximal
run of consecutive non-blank lines (chunks are separated by blank lines --
typically distinct paragraphs, bullet points, or doctest blocks). Only a
chunk whose OWN least-indented line is at or below the header's indentation
is flagged/fixed; a chunk that is already indented deeper than the header is
left alone even if a sibling chunk in the same section is broken. This
matters because some sections (e.g. a ``Notes:`` block with several
paragraphs at different, individually-correct depths) are not uniformly
indented to begin with.

``References:`` is exempt from this check: mkdocstrings/griffe does not
require a references/bibliography block's body to be indented deeper than
the header to render correctly, so a ``References:`` body written at the
same indent as its own header is fine and is never flagged.

A chunk that itself looks like a standalone "Some Label:" header followed by
its own more-deeply-indented lines is also left alone, no matter how shallow
its own indent is. griffe recognises *any* such "label + indented body" line
pair as its own section/admonition, splitting it out of whatever section it
follows -- forcing it deeper to satisfy the enclosing section's indent rule
would instead make griffe fold its text into that section's own content.

What is checked (informational by default; ``--strict`` fails the build):

* ``section-not-indented`` -- a chunk within a (non-``References``) Google
  section's body has at least one non-blank line at or below the header's own
  indentation. The body runs from the line after the header to the next
  Google section header (regardless of ITS indentation -- sections are
  siblings, never nested one inside another, even if a docstring
  inconsistently writes one deeper than another), the docstring's closing
  ``\"\"\"``/``'''``, or EOF.

What ``--fix`` does: shifts every line in a flagged chunk right by a constant
number of spaces, just enough to bring its least-indented line to the
header's indent plus 4. This is a uniform shift -- it does not change any
line's indentation RELATIVE to the others in the chunk, so an already-nested
continuation line (e.g. a wrapped array repr or a ``...`` doctest
continuation) keeps its own relative offset. The docstring's closing quote
line is never shifted. A chunk that is already indented deeper than its
header (even if inconsistently deeper than intended) is left untouched, and
so is every chunk of a ``References:`` section.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_docstring_indent.py [PATH ...] [--strict] [--fix]
                                             [--quiet] [--diff [REF]]

PATH defaults to ``qmcpy``. ``--diff [REF]`` (REF defaults to ``develop``)
restricts scanning/fixing to files that changed relative to REF -- committed
on the branch, modified in the working tree, or untracked.
