"""Ratchet gate for the informational docstring/annotation checks.

`check_docstring`, `pydoclint`, and `annotate_public_api_types` are
informational today (see F9/F10 in the PR #613 review) because fixing every
existing violation before enabling them as hard gates is a large, separate
undertaking. This script tracks each check's full-tree violation count in
`scripts/baseline_counts.json` and fails only if a count *increases* --
new violations are blocked; the existing backlog is not required to be
cleared just to land an unrelated change.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_baseline.py            # compare against the baseline
    python scripts/check_baseline.py --update    # write current counts as the new baseline
    python scripts/check_baseline.py --diff [REF]  # also gate on the PR's own diff

`--update` is for a change that intentionally reduces (or, with justification
in the PR description, increases) one of these counts.

The whole-repo ratchet above only catches a *net* increase: a PR that fixes N
pre-existing issues elsewhere while introducing M<N new ones in its own files
reports "improved" and passes. `--diff [REF]` (REF defaults to `develop`) adds
a second, independent check: for just the `qmcpy/*.py` files that changed
relative to REF, each tool is run against both that ref's content and the
current worktree's content, and it fails if a file's own change made any
count go up -- independent of the whole-repo trend.

A mid-migration branch (e.g. adding type hints to signatures across many
files) can make a count spike well above the committed baseline before it
comes back down -- pydoclint's DOC105/106/107 cross-check every arg's
signature type against its docstring type, so partially-applied hints
surface more mismatches than having no hints at all. That is expected, not
a bug in this script: `make check` will keep reporting "REGRESSED" for that
check until the migration is complete and `--update` is run to record the
new, lower count.
