## QMCPy

Package of 5 main components implemented as abstract classes with concrete implementations

- **Stopping Criterion** to determine number of samples necessary to meet error tolerence.
- **Integrand** whose expected value will be approximated.
- **True Measure** that the Integrand is defined with respect to.
- **Discrete Distribution** from which to generate nodes/sequences that can be either iid (for Monte Carlo) or low-discrepancy (for quasi-Monte Carlo).
- **Accumulate Data** to store information from integration process.
