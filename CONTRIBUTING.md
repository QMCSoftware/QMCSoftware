## Installation

In a git enabled terminal (e.g. [bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows) with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed and C compilers enabled (Windows users may need to install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)), run

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/QMCSoftware/QMCSoftware.git
cd QMCSoftware
git checkout develop
conda create --name qmcpy python=3.12
conda activate qmcpy
pip install -e .[dev]
~~~

While `dev` contains the most complete set of install dependencies, a number of other install dependency groups can be found in our `pyproject.toml` file. If running in the `zsh` terminal you may need to use

~~~bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
~~~

### 📚 Using `qmcpy` in courses (`class` extra)

`qmcpy` provides a `class` optional dependency group that installs a
complete teaching environment (JupyterLab, plotting, statistics, and utilities)
in addition to `qmcpy` itself.

For a typical course setup, you can do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QMCSoftware/QMCSoftware.git
cd QMCSoftware
pip install -e ".[class]"
```

or for a heavy-duty version
```bash
pip install -e ".[class,dev]"
```

## Tests

Doctests and unittests take a few minute to run with

~~~bash
make tests_no_docker
~~~

Optionally, you may install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and then run all tests with

~~~bash
make tests
~~~

Please see the targets in the makefile for more granular control over tests.

## Documentation

~~~bash
pip install -e ".[doc]"
~~~

This installs the documentation extras, including `pylint`.

### Ensure `pyreverse` is on your PATH

`pyreverse` must be available as a command-line tool. If it is not, verify your PATH as below.

* MacOS / Linux 

~~~bash
conda activate qmcpy
# check that pyreverse is found
which pyreverse || echo "pyreverse not found"
pyreverse --help
~~~

Alternative:
	
~~~bash
	# add user scripts dir to PATH (zsh example; use ~/.bashrc for bash)
	echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
	# preferred: open a new terminal so the new PATH is picked up
	source ~/.zshrc
~~~

* Windows (cmd or PowerShell)

~~~powershell
conda activate qmcpy
# check that pyreverse is found
where pyreverse
pyreverse --help
~~~

If `where pyreverse` cannot find the command, ensure your Python Scripts directory is on your `PATH`. A common way to locate it is:

~~~powershell
python -m site --user-base
# then add "<that-path>\Scripts" to your PATH
~~~

You can update PATH via System settings or in your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`).

### Build the documentation

On MacOS / Linux (and on Windows via Git Bash, WSL, or any environment with `make`):

~~~bash
make doc
~~~

### Download PDF documentation

In the built HTML documentation:

1. Navigate to the **“Printable Docs”** section.
2. Use your browser’s print dialog:
   - **Windows / Linux:** `Ctrl+P`  
   - **MacOS:** `Cmd+P`
3. Choose **“Save as PDF”** and save to your preferred location.


## Demos

Demos are Jupyter notebooks which may be launched using the command

~~~bash
jupyter-lab
~~~

## Other Developer Tools

The [Developers Tools](https://qmcpy.org/references-for-python-and-mathematical-software-development/) page on [qmcpy.org](https://qmcpy.org) documents additional tools we have found helpful for mathematical software development and presentation.

## VSCode Tips

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Visual Studio Code) is the IDE of choice for many of our developers. Here we compile some helpful notes regarding additional setup for VSCode.

- Run `CMD`+`p` then `> Python: Select Interpreter` then select the `('qmcpy')` choice from the dropdown to link the qmcpy environment into your workspace. Now when you open a terminal, your command line should read `(qmcpy) username@...` which indicates the qmcpy environment has been automatically activated. Also, when debugging the qmcpy environment will be automatically used.
- Go to `File` and click `Save Workspace as...` to save a `qmcpy` workspace for future development.

Some VSCode extensions we found useful include

- Python
- Jupyter
- Markdown Preview Enhanced
- eps-preview, which requires
    - Postscript Language
    - pdf2svg
- Git Graph
- Code Spell Checker
