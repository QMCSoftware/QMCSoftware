## Building the Paper

### Remote Build 
The PDF is generated automatically on each commit:
1. Go to the [Actions page](https://github.com/sou-cheng-choi/qmcpy_joss/actions).
2. Open the latest workflow run.
3. Download the PDF from the Artifacts section.

### Local Build

Run:
```bash
make
```
This cleans outputs, combines bibliographies, builds `main.pdf` with Pandoc, and shows the word count.

Other Commands:

- `make clean`: Removes auxiliary files.
- `make cleanall`: Deletes all outputs, including PDFs.
- `make refs_all.bib`: Combines bibliography files.
- `make wordcount`: Counts words in `main.md` (excludes metadata/references).
- `make install-mac`:  Install required tools on macOS using Homebrew.
