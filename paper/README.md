## Building the Paper

### Remote Build 
The PDF is generated automatically on each commit:
1. Go to the [Actions page](https://github.com/sou-cheng-choi/qmcpy_joss/actions).
2. Open the latest workflow run.
3. Download the PDF from the Artifacts section.

### Local Build

Run:
```bash
cd paper
make
```
This cleans outputs, combines bibliographies, builds `main.pdf` with Pandoc, and shows the word count.

Or run the following command to produce `main.tex` (for arXiv) and compile `maintex.pdf`:
```bash   
make maintex_pdf
```

Other Commands:

- `make clean`: Removes auxiliary files.
- `make cleanall`: Deletes all outputs, including PDFs.
- `make main.bib`: Combines bibliography files.
- `make wordcount`: Counts words in `paper.md` (excludes metadata/references).
- `make install-mac`:  Install required tools on macOS using Homebrew.
