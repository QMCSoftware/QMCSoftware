@inbook{Marzouk2016,
	abstract = {We present the fundamentals of a measure transport approach to sampling. The idea is to construct a deterministic coupling -- i.e., a transport map -- between a complex ``target'' probability measure of interest and a simpler reference measure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference samples through the map. If the map is endowed with a triangular structure, one can also easily generate samples from conditionals of the target measure. We consider two different and complementary scenarios: first, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available and, second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite collection of samples. We show that in both settings, the desired transports can be characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address practical issues associated with the optimization-based construction of transports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing monotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining approximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces. Approximate transports can also be used to ``Gaussianize'' complex distributions and thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We place the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections with other optimization-based samplers, with inference and density estimation schemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation-based approaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction of transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the target distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure). The approaches and algorithms presented here have direct applications to Bayesian computation and to broader problems of stochastic simulation.},

In this paper we consider an alternative model of the random field, in which the random variables have the same uniform distribution on an interval, but the random variables enter the input field as periodic functions. The field is constructed in such a way as to have the same mean and covariance function as the affine random field. Higher moments differ from the affine case, but in general the periodic model seems no less desirable. The new model of the random field is used to compute expected values of a quantity of interest arising from an elliptic PDE with random coefficients. The periodicity is shown to yield a higher order cubature convergence rate of \$\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/p})\$ independently of the dimension when used in conjunction with rank-1 lattice cubature rules constructed using suitably chosen smoothness-driven product and order dependent weights, where \$n\$ is the number of lattice points and \$p\$ is the summability exponent of the fluctuations in the series expansion of the random coefficient. We present numerical examples that assess the performance of our method. },

	abstract = { We propose an approximation method for high-dimensional 1-periodic functions based on the multivariate ANOVA decomposition. We provide analysis of classical ANOVA decomposition on the torus and prove some important properties, such as the inheritance of smoothness for Sobolev type spaces and the weighted Wiener algebra. We exploit special kinds of sparsity in the ANOVA decomposition with the aim of approximating a function in a scattered data or black-box approximation scenario. This method allows us to simultaneously achieve an importance ranking on dimensions and dimension interactions (referred to as an attribute ranking in some applications). In scattered data approximation we rely on a special algorithm based on the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (or NFFT) for fast multiplication with arising Fourier matrices. For black-box approximation we choose the well-known rank-1 lattices as sampling schemes and show properties of the arising special lattices. },

	abstract = {We introduce an algorithm to reduce large data sets using so-called digital nets, which are well distributed point sets in the unit cube. These point sets together with weights, which depend on the data set, are used to represent the data. We show that this can be used to reduce the computational effort needed in finding good parameters in machine learning algorithms. To illustrate our method we provide some numerical examples for neural networks.},

@article{pmlr-v80-chen18f,
	abstract = {An important task in computational statistics and machine learning is to approximate a posterior distribution $p(x)$ with an empirical measure supported on a set of representative points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$. This paper focuses on methods where the selection of points is essentially deterministic, with an emphasis on achieving accurate approximation when $n$ is small. To this end, we present Stein Points. The idea is to exploit either a greedy or a conditional gradient method to iteratively minimise a kernel Stein discrepancy between the empirical measure and $p(x)$. Our empirical results demonstrate that Stein Points enable accurate approximation of the posterior at modest computational cost. In addition, theoretical results are provided to establish convergence of the method.},
