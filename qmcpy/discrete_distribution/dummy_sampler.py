class DummySampler(AbstractLDDiscreteDistribution):
    r"""Placeholder discrete distribution for constructing true-measure
    marginals.

    ``DummySampler`` is useful when a true measure is needed only for its
    dimension, transform, range, and weight behavior. QMCPy's current
    ``AbstractTrueMeasure`` interface requires each true measure to be
    constructed with an attached sampler, but ``ProductMeasure`` samples only
    from its own outer sampler.

    Direct calls to ``DummySampler`` raise an error because the sampler is only
    a construction placeholder and cannot generate meaningful QMC points.

    Examples:
        >>> from qmcpy import DummySampler
        >>> sampler = DummySampler(2)
        >>> sampler.d
        2
        >>> sampler.replications
        1
        >>> sampler(4)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        qmcpy.util.exceptions_warnings.ParameterError: DummySampler is only a construction placeholder for ProductMeasure child true measures and cannot generate samples.
