class DummySampler(AbstractLDDiscreteDistribution):
    r"""Placeholder discrete distribution for constructing true-measure
    marginals.

    ``DummySampler`` is useful when a true measure is needed only for its
    dimension, transform, range, and weight behavior. QMCPy's current
    ``AbstractTrueMeasure`` interface requires each true measure to be
    constructed with an attached sampler, but ``ProductMeasure`` samples only
    from its own outer sampler.

    Direct calls to ``DummySampler`` raise an error because the sampler is only
    a construction placeholder and cannot generate meaningful QMC points.

    Examples:
        >>> from qmcpy import DummySampler
        >>> sampler = DummySampler(2)
        >>> sampler.d
        2
        >>> sampler.replications
        1
        >>> sampler(4)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        qmcpy.util.exceptions_warnings.ParameterError: DummySampler is only a construction placeholder for ProductMeasure child true measures and cannot generate samples.

        Args:
            dimension (Union[int, list, tuple, np.ndarray]): Dimension of the placeholder sampler. A list, tuple, or array specifies unique coordinate indices. Defaults to `1`.
            replications (Union[None, int]): Replication metadata preserved when spawning placeholders. `None` records no explicit replication axis. Defaults to `None`.
            seed (Union[None, int, np.random.SeedSequence]): Seed used to initialize the sampler state and spawn child samplers. Defaults to `None`.
            warn (bool): Compatibility argument matching other discrete-distribution constructors. It is ignored because `DummySampler` cannot generate samples. Defaults to `True`.

        Raises:
            ParameterError: If an array-like `dimension` is not one-dimensional with unique entries, if it exceeds the dimension limit, or if `replications` is negative.
