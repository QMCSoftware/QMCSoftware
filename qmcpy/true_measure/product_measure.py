class ProductMeasure(AbstractTrueMeasure):
    r"""
    Product true measure for independent composition of marginal true measures.

    ``ProductMeasure`` represents an independent product of smaller true
    measures. Each marginal may be one-dimensional or multidimensional. If the
    marginal true measures have dimensions

    d_1, d_2, ..., d_k,

    then the product measure has total dimension

    d = d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k.

    A single d-dimensional outer sampler is used. Its unit-cube samples are
    split into coordinate blocks, one block for each marginal true measure.
    Each marginal transforms its own block, and the transformed blocks are
    concatenated back together.

    For example, if the marginals are

        marginal 1: 2D Gaussian
        marginal 2: 1D zero-inflated exponential

    then ``ProductMeasure`` uses a 3D sampler and returns samples with three
    coordinates. The first two coordinates come from the Gaussian marginal,
    and the third coordinate comes from the zero-inflated exponential marginal.

    The marginal true measures still have their own samplers because QMCPy's
    current ``AbstractTrueMeasure`` API requires every true measure to be
    constructed with one. A ``DummySampler`` is useful for this construction
    placeholder role. Inside ``ProductMeasure``, marginal samplers are not
    sampled directly when product samples are generated. The marginals provide
    dimension, range, transform, and weight behavior. A future
    samplerless/template true-measure mode may be useful, but that is separate
    from this class.

    Notes
    -----
    Exact product weights are supported for direct marginal true measures. For
    recursively composed marginal measures, sampling is supported through
    QMCPy's recursive transform helper, but exact final-space product weights
    are not currently implemented here.

    Examples
    --------
    Combine two one-dimensional uniform true measures:

    >>> from qmcpy.discrete_distribution import DigitalNetB2, DummySampler
    >>> from qmcpy.true_measure import ProductMeasure, Uniform
    >>> marginals = [
    ...     Uniform(DummySampler(1), lower_bound=0, upper_bound=2),
    ...     Uniform(DummySampler(1), lower_bound=10, upper_bound=12),
    ... ]
    >>> pm = ProductMeasure(sampler=DigitalNetB2(2, seed=9), marginals=marginals)
    >>> x = pm(4)
    >>> x.shape
    (4, 2)
    >>> bool(((0 <= x[:, 0]) & (x[:, 0] <= 2)).all())
    True

    The outer sampler controls replications:

    >>> pm = ProductMeasure(
    ...     sampler=DigitalNetB2(2, seed=9, replications=3),
    ...     marginals=marginals,
    ... )
    >>> pm(4).shape
    (3, 4, 2)

    The ``DummySampler`` marginal samplers are only construction placeholders
    required by the current ``AbstractTrueMeasure`` interface.
    ``ProductMeasure`` samples from its own outer sampler.

    Marginals may have different dimensions:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from qmcpy.true_measure import Gaussian
    >>> marginals = [
    ...     Gaussian(
    ...         DummySampler(2),
    ...         mean=[0, 0],
    ...         covariance=np.eye(2),
    ...     ),
    ...     Uniform(DummySampler(1), lower_bound=10, upper_bound=12),
    ... ]
    >>> pm = ProductMeasure(sampler=DigitalNetB2(3, seed=12), marginals=marginals)
    >>> pm(4).shape
    (4, 3)
    """

    def __init__(self, sampler, marginals):
        """
        Initialize a product measure from one sampler and several marginals.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sampler : AbstractDiscreteDistribution
            The sampler for the whole product measure. Its dimension must
            equal the sum of the marginal dimensions.

        marginals : list or tuple of AbstractTrueMeasure
            Independent true measures to place side by side. A marginal may
            itself be multidimensional.

        Why one sampler?
        ----------------
        The product measure should be driven by one total-dimensional QMC
        point set. We do not generate separate QMC samples from each marginal.
        Instead, one sample u in [0,1]^d is split into blocks:

            u = (u_marginal_1, u_marginal_2, ..., u_marginal_k).

        This preserves the intended total-dimensional QMC construction.
