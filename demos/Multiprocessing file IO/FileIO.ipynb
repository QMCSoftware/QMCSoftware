    "**File Management Functions for Appending, Viewing, Clearing, and Removing Last Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This code snippet provides a set of functions for managing files in Python. The `add_to_file` function appends data to the end of a specified file, `view_file` loads and returns all objects stored in the file, `clear_file` empties the content of the file, and `remove_last_object` removes the last object appended to the file while preserving the rest. These functions are useful for handling data persistence and file management within a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment."
