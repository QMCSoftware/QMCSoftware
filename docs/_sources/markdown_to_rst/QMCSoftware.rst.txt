Quasi-Monte Carlo Community Software
====================================

--------------

Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are used to approximate multivariate
integrals. They have four main components: an integrand, a discrete
distribution, summary output data, and stopping criterion. Information
about the integrand is obtained as a sequence of values of the function
sampled at the data-sites of the discrete distribution. The stopping
criterion tells the algorithm when the user-specified error tolerance
has been satisfied. We are developing a framework that allows
collaborators in the QMC community to develop plug-and-play modules in
an effort to produce more efficient and portable QMC software. Each of
the above four components is an abstract class. Abstract classes specify
the common properties and methods of all subclasses. The ways in which
the four kinds of classes interact with each other are also specified.
Subclasses then flesh out different integrands, sampling schemes, and
stopping criteria. Besides providing developers a way to link their new
ideas with those implemented by the rest of the QMC community, we also
aim to provide practitioners with state-of-the-art QMC software for
their applications.
