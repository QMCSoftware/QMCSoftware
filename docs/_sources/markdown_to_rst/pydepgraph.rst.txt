pydepgraph - A dependencies analyzer for Python
===============================================

Introduction
------------

pydepgraph is a stand-alone program that analyzes one or more tree of
Python sources to find dependencies amongst the files, and output a DOT
file, suitable to be displayed or converted to an image.

Usage
-----

From the command line help.

::

   usage: pydepgraph [-h] [-p PATH] [-e EXCLUDE] [-c CLUSTERS] [-r] [-g GRAPH]
                     [-C]

   Draw the dependency graph of a Python project.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -p PATH, --path PATH  comma separated list of paths to include
     -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                           comma separated list of paths to exclude
     -c CLUSTERS, --clusters CLUSTERS
                           comma separated list of clusters
     -r, --no-recursive    do not descend into subdirectories
     -g GRAPH, --graph GRAPH
                           type of graph: 0 (without clusters), 1 (with
                           clusters), 2 (only clusters), 3 (only clusters,
                           drawing also self edges
     -C, --concentrate     merge common path of different edges

It is important to notice that the paths specified with the -p switch
must be the root of the source tree, in order to let pydepgraph
recognize correctly the dependencies. For example, if you want that the
instruction

.. code:: python

   import tornado.ioloop

is correctly assessed as an edge to tornado/ioloop.py, you need to
specify the parent directory of tornado (i.e., the grandparent of
ioloop.py) in the path list. In future versions this limitation could be
removed to allow sub-project inspections.
