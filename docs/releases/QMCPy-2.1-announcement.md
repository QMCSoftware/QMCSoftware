# QMCPy v2.1 Released – Quasi-Monte Carlo Community Software in Python

**Date**: 2025-12-10

We are happy to announce version 2.1 of QMCPy, our open-source Python library for quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods used to approximate multivariate integrals. This release continues our work to provide reliable, modular, and well-tested QMC software for research and teaching.

Notable additions and improvements in v2.1:

1. Adaptive smoothness kernel and Cholesky option for multitask kernels.  
2. Improved numerical stability (overcame cancellation errors) and other robustness fixes.  
3. Improved demos of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) integrand support for financial applications.  
4. Integration with [**Parsl**](https://parsl-project.org) for parallel workflows of unit tests using [**testbook**](https://github.com/nteract/testbook) for Jupyter notebooks to improve reliability of demos and code base.  
5. Class installation option for Illinois Tech students and instructors using QMCPy in coursework.  
6. Documentation updates, demo patches, and various bug fixes across the codebase.  

We welcome your questions, feedback, and contributions.
